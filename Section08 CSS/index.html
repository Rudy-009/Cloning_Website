    <div id="one">
        In 2007, Udemy (you-de-mee, portmanteau of you + academy)[7] founders 
        Eren Bali and Oktay Caglar built a software for a live virtual classroom 
        while living in Turkey.

        February 2010, the founders tried to raise venture capital funding, 
        but the idea failed to impress investors and they were rejected 30 times, 
        according to Gagan Biyani.[9] In response to this, they bootstrapped the 
        development of the product and launched Udemy—"The Academy of You"—in May 2010.[9]

        Within a few months, 1,000 instructors had created about 2,000 courses, and Udemy 
        had nearly 10,000 registered users. Based on this favorable market reaction, 
        they decided to attempt another round of financing, and raised $1 million in venture funding by August.[10][11]
